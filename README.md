Resource to learn the code

I first had to learn what an insertion sort was.  once I understood what the final product should look like I searched for some code that I could understand how it was working.

It requires 2 loops, the first for loop starts at position [0] and works up through the array.  at each position, the second loop checks the next item against the current first loop item, and subsequently back down to [0] as the first loop progresses forward.  This moves each item backward from its current position toward [0] to a point where it is higher than the one before it and lower than the one after it.

The final foreach loop is for printing the result to the console.
